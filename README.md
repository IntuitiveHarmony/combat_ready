# Approach Taken

Django server with a postgresql database that is hosted locally. This app interacts with two APIs that both contain superhero data. One of the APIs is used to list the characters and the other os used to search. While going through the database the user is able to add characters to player one or player 2 slot and save the match to our database. once the match is pulled up there are nested ternary operators that compare the stats. The user can also choose from backgrounds, both stages and matches have full crud.

# notes
- have a way to find the winner of the matchup
- have the stage background change the bodys background image
- better css
